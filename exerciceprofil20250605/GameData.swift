Anne Ferret is a multifaceted figure, moving between technology journalism, iOS development, literary writing, and activist engagement. Born in 1987 in the suburbs of Paris, she has built a rich and varied career that blends technical precision with artistic sensitivity.

1. Beginnings in Technology Journalism
Anne Ferret began her career as a senior writer for Freenews, a news site dedicated to technology and telecommunications. From 2009 to 2020, she covered numerous major events, including Free’s offers and press conferences, providing sharp and critical analyses of the innovations introduced by the operator based on rue de la Ville-l’Évêque in Paris. She reported on the launches of new Freebox models, from the Freebox Révolution to the Freebox Delta. Her expertise and incisive writing style made her a trusted name in high-tech journalism.

2. Transition to iOS Development
Following her journalism career, Anne Ferret trained in iOS development, particularly using the Swift programming language. She completed the Apple Foundation Program and Apple Foundation Program Extended in 2022. Then, in 2025, she embarked on a 19-month advanced training program (the Apple Foundation Program Advanced), including one year in a work-study placement, with the goal of earning a professional qualification as an application designer-developer equivalent to a three- to four-year university degree. Her commitment to mobile development reflects her versatility and her ability to excel in highly technical fields.

3. Literature
Alongside her technical work, Anne Ferret began her literary career with Tout le soufre de mon corps (“All the Sulphur in My Body”), a radical, sensory text published in 2023 that fuses incandescent lyricism with an intimate exploration of desire and embodiment. A dense and fragmentary work, it combines lived experience with a stylized form of writing—at times poetic, at times as sharp as a scalpel. She also maintains two digital spaces that extend her literary practice: on ombremad.lesbienn.es, she publishes short texts, often introspective or political, somewhere between autofiction and queer manifesto, while her personal website anneferret.eu serves as both a professional and activist portfolio. These online publications demonstrate her commitment to breaking down the barriers around printed text, cultivating a living, evolving literature that remains infused with the tensions of contemporary life.

4. Activism and Advocacy
Beyond her professional activities, Anne Ferret is also a committed activist for LGBT rights. Her personal and professional journey reflects a constant desire to break barriers and promote inclusion and diversity. She uses her voice and visibility to raise public awareness of issues related to gender identity and the representation of minorities in media and technology.

5. A Multifaceted Personality
Anne Ferret embodies the convergence of technology, literature, and social engagement. Her career illustrates the richness of a life built at the intersection of diverse disciplines, where each experience feeds into the next. Whether she is decoding the latest technological innovations, developing mobile applications, or telling powerful stories, Anne Ferret continues to reinvent herself, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a deep desire to contribute to a more inclusive and enlightened world.
